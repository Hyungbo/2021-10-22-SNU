# Abstract

The talk presents some methods to design feedback controllers using low-complexity data collected from dynamical systems excited by persistently exciting inputs. The design is based on the solution of formulas expressed via data-dependent semidefinite programs. The methods provide formal guarantees on the correctness and robustness of the controllers.

# Biography

Claudio De Persis received the the Ph.D. degree in System Engineering in 2000 from the University of Rome "La Sapienza", Italy. He is currently a Professor at the Engineering and Technology Institute, Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics, University of Groningen, the Netherlands. He is also affiliated with the Jan Willems Center for Systems and Control. Previously he was with the Department of Mechanical Automation and Mechatronics, University of Twente and with the Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering, University of Rome "La Sapienza". He was a Research Associate at the Department of Systems Science and Mathematics, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA, in 2000-2001, and at the Department of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA, in 2001-2002. His main research interest is in control theory, and his recent research focuses on dynamical networks, cyberphysical systems, smart grids and resilient control. He was an Editor of the International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control (2006-2013), an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology (2010-2015), and of the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (2012- 2015). He is currently an Associate Editor of Automatica (2013-present) and of IEEE Control Systems Letters (2017-present).

# Abstract

This talk generally introduces our study on how to use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve UAV related control problems. We will start from a brief introduction of the principles of RL methods, followed by our work on solving basic attitude control problem based on modeless DRL method. Then move to a more complicated disturbance suppression control problem, and at last briefly introduce RL based upper level path planning method. We will also discuss the pros and cons of RL based methods when applying to control problems.
